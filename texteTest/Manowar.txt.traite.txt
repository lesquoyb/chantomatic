story
a
real
story
yes
tell
me
about
when
you
were
a
boy
well
then
i
shall
have
to
take
you
back
with
me
a
long
way
in
time
it
was
my
thirteenth
year
on
a
cold
winter
s
day
as
i
walked
through
the
enchanted
forest
i
heard
the
sound
of
horses
and
men
at
arms
i
felt
compelled
to
walk
on
and
find
the
place
of
these
sounds
and
when
the
forest
did
clear
i
was
standing
on
a
hill
before
me
there
was
a
great
plain
upon
it
the
armies
of
the
world
standing
waiting
i
thought
to
myself
for
whom
or
for
what
are
they
waiting
suddenly
a
gust
of
wind
came
up
from
the
north
there
appeared
a
lone
rider
holding
a
sword
of
steel
then
from
the
south
came
another
bearing
a
battle
ax
from
the
east
came
a
third
holding
a
spiked
club
and
finally
from
the
west
a
rider
who
wielded
a
great
hammer
of
war
with
them
came
their
soldiers
of
death
followed
by
an
army
of
immortals
they
were
few
in
number
but
the
look
in
their
eyes
told
all
who
beheld
them
that
they
would
leave
this
day
only
in
victory
or
death
and
there
was
a
great
silence
my
heart
began
to
pound
storm
clouds
filled
the
sky
with
darkness
rain
came
and
the
four
winds
blew
with
such
anger
that
i
held
fast
to
a
tree
i
watched
the
four
riders
raise
their
weapons
into
the
air
without
warning
screaming
their
war
cry
they
led
the
attack
down
to
the
battle
they
rode
they
met
the
armies
of
the
world
with
a
mighty
clash
i
could
feel
the
ground
shake
the
earth
drank
much
blood
that
day
each
of
the
four
was
unto
himself
a
whirlwind
of
doom
when
the
smoke
did
clear
many
thousands
were
dead
there
was
much
blood
and
gore
their
bodies
lay
broken
and
scattered
across
the
battlefield
like
brown
leaves
blown
by
the
wind
and
i
saw
the
four
ride
together
to
the
top
of
the
hill
while
below
them
the
soldiers
of
death
assembled
all
those
who
would
now
swear
allegiance
to
them
and
the
four
spoke
the
words
of
the
warriors
prayer
gods
of
war
i
call
you
my
sword
is
by
my
side
i
seek
a
life
of
honor
free
from
all
false
pride
i
will
crack
the
whip
with
a
bold
mighty
hail

death

hail
them
without
end

their
voices

battle
hymn

whips
and
armour

hail
to
thee
our
infantry

freedom
shone
now
blood
and
steel
meet
bone
in
the
light
of
the
battle
s
way
the
sands
of
time
will
shake
how
proud
our
soldiers
stand
with
mace
and
chain
in
hand
sound
of
charge
into
glory
ride
over
the
top
of
their
vanguished
pride
to
the
battle
we
ride
we
crossed
a
starlit
sky
no
space
no
time
we
ll
catch
the
wind
strange
losses
men
died
we
crossed
a
starlit
sky
and
still
no
space
and
time
we
ll
catch
the
wind
