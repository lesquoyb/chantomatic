Remember those walls I built
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make up a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray It won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

Halo, halo

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own all 'cause you won't
Listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened, there is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died so long ago
Oh, I'm screaming out and my dreams'll be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own all 'cause you won't
Listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but I will complete
Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own.

{Drunk In Love}

I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in
the club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night
And everything alright
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these
lights
Boy, I'm drinking
Park it in my lot 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing, if you scared, call that
reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de brignac, gangster wife
Louie sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags he wear it out
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic to my boy toys
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic til my voice
hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my
surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body
Been serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good,
good

(I'm nice right now)
Hold up
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up
Stumbled all in the house time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest
bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that third, I wanna see all the
shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slip the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights you gonna need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breastases is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night

Never tired, never tired
I been sipping, that's the only thing that's keeping me on
fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you

{Broken-Hearted Girl}

You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still you live inside of me
So tell me how is that

You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one

And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't
erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you babe
I don't wanna to play that part

I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way
No, no, I don't wanna a broken heart
And I don't wanna to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl

Something that I feel I need to say
But up 'til now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out

You say you got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving of me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one

And yes there are times when I hate you but I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you, I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby
I don't wanna to play that part

I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way
No, no, I don't wanna a broken heart
And I don't wanna to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna to play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way
No, no, I don't wanna a broken heart
I don't wanna to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl, broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl, no broken-hearted girl

Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I´m doing my own little thing
Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me

I´m up on him, he up on me
Don´t pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years
You can´t be mad at me

'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don´t be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it

I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Got me tighter in my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I can care less what you think

I need no permission, did I mention
Don´t pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn and now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me

Oh, oh, oh...

Don´t treat me to the things of the world
I´m not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve

Here´s a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms, say I´m the one you own
If you don´t, you´ll be alone and like a ghost I'll be
gone

A-towns up, deuces down its the new call
And you can dial 1-888-CUT-SOMETHING
Im your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something

Aint no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, Im a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets
Its the player from the Point
And your girl from the D

Are you infatuated with me
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move

I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my, my style is so crazy
I think you like it baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With this hip hop star
Bad boots on, pants down low
I'm a hip hop star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind?
Would you taste my love if I kick it tight

I have none to waste with you
I guess you can say
My style is so crazy
I think you like it baby
Do you want to get messy?
I dare you to undress me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With this hip hop star
Bamboos on pants down low
I'm a hip hop star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

Undress me, undress me
You can come
Come baby, undress me

Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them dripping down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root
Knocking boots and stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!

A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! Spit game!
Venom to get it up in em, let me P pop that thang

First check her brain to see if shes sane
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins, man!

There is nothing i won't do for you

I feel so safe when i'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothin
Saving it all for you

You was really buggin
So I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve, you
Too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn
You said I move to slow
I showed you to the door
You said you call me later
I said don't call no more
Its cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
Cuz you showed me your true face baby
The first time I said no

******************

Took me a while
But I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify
Make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out
To be picked on
talked bout outta me friends mouth
I've been beat down
Til he turned my life around
(turn my life around)

seems like I always fall short
of bein worthy
Cuz I aint good enough
but he still loves me

I aint no superstar
The spotlight aint shinin on me
(no no no no no)
cuz I aint good enough
but he still loves me
Loves me

I used to wake up somedays
and wish i'd stayed asleep
cuz i went to bed on top of the world
today the worlds on top of me
everybody's got opinions
(they share)
They aint been in my position
(they don't care)
that it breaks my heart when I hear what they
have to say about me yeah
(what they say)

seems like I always fall short (fallin short)
of bein worthy (Lord I aint worthy)
Cuz I aint good enough (no no)
but he still loves me (still loves me)

I aint no superstar
I wanna be for you
The spotlight aint shinin on me
(but i want to be for you)
cuz I aint good enough
but he still loves me

I'm not perfect
(I'm not perfect)
Yes I do wrong
(yes I do wrong)
I'm trying my best
(trying my best but)
But it aint good enough
(just aint good enough)
Shunned by the world
(shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
Cuz I aint good
But he still loves me
(I just aint good enough)

If you aint worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed
To be loved, loved

stand for him or fall for anything
cuz through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do
Without out pain

Feels like we always fall short
Of bein worthy (we are not worthy)
Cuz I aint good enough
But he still loves me
I aint no superstar
(I aint no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord)
The spotlight aint shinin on me
Cuz I aint good enough

Cuz I aint good enough
